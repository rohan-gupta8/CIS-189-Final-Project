## Results
Overall, the results for our project were quite an improvement upon the game's built-in combat automation, called *Revolution*. In testing, using a 1 minute time block, the **melee** style, and max-hit mode on the combat dummies (to remove randomness), our model achieved ~265,000 damage while Revolution only achieved ~215,000 damage. This is quite a significant improvement, although current top-level gameplay did have better results (~300,000 damage). The videos can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ayiQsKvaNSHNRPlkAn62eE-3qhn6hHQ4Abdfa1I81h0/edit?usp=sharing) towards the end of the slideshow. They show the three aforementioned trials. Obviously, in the video for our model (second one), we used the output of our program with the parameters `seconds=60` and `style="melee"`. 
While the output of the model is not easily directly tested (for the reason that the user needs a RuneScape account with all of the abilities), it would be possible to remove some of the abilities in order to test with a basic character. However, this would not necessarily guarantee good results.
